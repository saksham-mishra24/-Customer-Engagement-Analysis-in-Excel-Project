## **Project Overview**

In 2022, **365 Company** introduced new features to its learning platform to enhance student engagement and drive growth. These features included:

- 🎮 **XP System**: Students could track progress, level up, and earn rewards.
- 💰 **In-App Coins**: Earned coins could be exchanged for special awards.
- 🏆 **Leaderboard**: Students competed for top positions and earned weekly rewards.
- 🔥 **Streaks**: Encouraged consistent learning habits.
- 📚 **Expanded Course Library**: Offered a broader range of topics to attract a larger audience.

This project analyzes whether these new features successfully increased student engagement. Using **Microsoft Excel**, I performed a detailed analysis of a real-world dataset to uncover insights and answer key business questions.
